# gallery-content-slide
Javascript that adds content under a line of floated elements. 

So basically each content coresponds to its id (like content 1 is for the id 1) and so on.

The way the blocks are put is basically 3 per line like this

    1  2  3   <-- when i click on either of those id's fetch their respective content and
	        <--- add it here after the 3rd element in a new block, basically between the lines.
    4  5  6

    7  8
